    "    The figure above shows a wind vane sensor. It is used to measure the wind direction. The sensor is mounted to the met mast with a predefined direction facing true north. It is shaped so that the wind flow will rotate the fin until it going in the direction of the wind speed. The position of the fin translates to the wind direction reading.\n",

    "    When scouting a location to be a potential wind park, accurate information about the wind speed is vital. Hence, it is critical to eliminate directional offsets. A directional offset is essentially a constant offset for a direction for a period of time. The major cause for an offset is it not being mounted correctly and as a result not facing true north. For example, when setting up a new wind vane sensor the sensor is sometimes set up with a 180° offset - facing in the opposite direction of true north. \n",

    "    The figure below shows the wind vanes for three met masts within one region on the left. On the right are the wind direction measurements of a nearby weather station as a reference. Both plots represent the distribution of the wind direction over 5 years for each sensor. The weather station data is pulled via an API call to WorldWeatherOnline. Despite the lower resolution of the weather station data (1h) to the met masts' measurements (10min), the weather station data is still a good enough approximation that may be used as a last checkpoint to detect directional offsets. In this example it is possible to see that both sensors of met mast M3 have an offset of about 90°.\n",

The frequency is divided into 16 bins starting at 12.25°. The bins are chosen this way so that there is a true north bin (348.75° to 12.25°). Then, the median is calculated among each sensor's mid point of each's respective bin with the highest frequency. It is expected that over a long period of time the frequency distribution of the wind direction will be similar in one location. Hence the calculated median represent the most likely highest frequent wind direction. Depending on how different each sensor's highest frequent bin is from the median, it will be adjusted. However, this will only happen if the difference is larger than 25°.\n",
