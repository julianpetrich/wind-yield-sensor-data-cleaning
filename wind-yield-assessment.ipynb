Because the wind power is dependent on the atmospheric variables temperature, pressure, relative humidity, and wind speed, met masts are used to collect data of those variables over a longer period of time. Additionally, the mast is collecting data on the wind direction over time as changes in wind direction may affect wind energy production. Commonly, a met mast collects data of wind speed and direction at multiple altitudes."
